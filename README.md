# JavaScript Course Progress 🚀

This repository tracks my progress in the [Complete JavaScript Course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## 📌 About This Repo
- This repository contains **starter code** and **final solutions** for each section of the course.
- I use it to track my learning and gradually build my JavaScript skills.

## 📂 Folder Structure
At the beginning of each section, the folder contains:
- A **starter** folder – where I write my own code and complete exercises.
- A **final** folder – provided by the instructor, which contains completed solutions.

### 🔄 How I Organize My Progress:
1. I work inside the **starter** folder for each section.
2. Once I complete the section, I:
   - **Rename the "starter" folder to "final"** (since it's now my own completed work).
   - **Delete the original "final" folder** from the instructor to keep my repository clean.
